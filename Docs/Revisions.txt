//modify clock year value write command, compatible with Tstat6, for example, if write 2017, just write 17 to the register, before need write 2017.

//rev 5_3
//2017-9-11
//fixed cooling mode, sometimes jumps to heating mode bug. merge pid task with control logic to avoid pid[x] value been changed by wrong.

//2017-9-7 
//a.fixed when intialize ram data, write wrong default schedule value to the eeprom 
//b. fiexd ION board (TSTAT8_HUNTER) analog output issue, before the output value is reverse.
//c. add led indicate for on/off inputs
//modify code to compatible with hardware rev3 and hardware rev4, now only one hex file.

//rev5_2
//2017-07-20 using new bacnet librery rev10, fixed when send write command by yabe software, unit response abort message. reason: BACNET_MAX_PRIORITY must set to 16
//2017-07-18  modify on/off input, only support dry contact, not support voltage on/off range

//rev5_1
//add communication icon
//add bacnet schedule

//rev5_0
//fixed input ON/OFF range
//Tstat7 add baudrate select option on advanced keypad menu
//fixed when set to factory default, the degree value not initial well bug.

//rev4_9
//using new bacnet lib rev8

//rev4_8
//tstat7 modify occ/unocc button, before it dose not work well
//bacnet station number can not be more than 50, bacnet library need to be fixed.temperary set it to 50 for this version.

//rev 4_5
//add communication icon on the left up of LCD
//modify BACNT staion number the same as modbus ID
//modify schedule: 
//---add away mode, using 2 bytes and 2 regs to store mode flag  
//---add away setpoint, change setpoint librery
//REV4_4 
//add free cooling function

//rev4_3 
//fixed 2-10V output not correct issue, the offset value is for Tstat6 hardware, not suit for tstat8,change 177 to 200.
//rev4_2
//2017-02-20
//fixed customer unit write problem
//2017-0214
//fixed transducer mode, and relay1 is indicating occupied/unoccupied
//fixed internal temperature sensor register, it will show internal sensor value when set pid loop1 to other inputs.  
//rev4_1
//2017-02-07
//add 50K thermistor table for Chen
//fixed menu part lock function and auto only function
//rev4_0
//2017-01-19
//fixed when temperature is bigger than 100C, the decimel point color is wrong.
//fixed manual temperature function, and dose not store the value in EEPROM if use write frequently, it may be damaged soon.
//use new fan icons.
//rev3_9
//2017-01-18
//adjust the display order for baudrate select
//fixed degree C/F icon for the top unit degree.
//fixed when use serial command to change the heat/cool mode, "SYS" icon dose't change err. 
//2017-01-17
//fixed when write current degree with the same degree, it still do the converter math bug.
//fixed output1 function can not be read/write problem, because it has the same low byte with scan command.
//fix if schedule is off, when change the fan mode by serial command, icon and setpoint not show right problem

//rev3_8 change LCD color and icons
//fixed pid3 table math in control logic routine. 

//REV3_7
//fixed override time saving problem
//add pir function, adjust pir judge threshold and add pir sensetivity register  
//add show ID command

//rev 3_4 fix negative temperture bug
//add new schedule 
//fixed scroll display problem, when AI1 and AI8 are not set the the first items, the value will in wrong order.
//fixed look up table problem, not it can show negative temperature normally.

//rev3_3
//fix srand/rand routine error
//add reset command to reset zigbee module after serial communication failure 1 minute 

//rev2_6
//cc 2016

//rev2_5
//cc 2016-04-21 fixed bug when set one cool or one heat stage, when pid result over 50%, it go to coast stage by wrong.	(pid library has been changed, OutputValue() routine modified)


//REV 2_4
//2016-3-31
//cc modify change baudrate function, in dealwith data routine, set a flag and response the command, then switch baudrate outside, so T3000 know if tstat accept this command
//cc fix a bug that fan auto table can not be changed.

//2016-3-17 cc 
//---modify baudrate keypad select, after change the baudrate by keypad, system dose not restart.
//---modify bacnet library rev2 

//REV 2_3
//2016-03-11 cc ---modify dealwithTag, make it logger, so do not response serial command too fast, otherwise minipannel will receive wrong values
//							---when initial tstat8 name, write all 20 charactors


//REV 2_2
//2016-03-09 cc modify control logic routine, use ram variables instead of read_eeprom(), during task switch, read_eeprom() function sometimes return wrong value, so 
//	 outputs will be wrong 

//REV2_1
//CC fixed digital output, add relay switch time to softtimer routine 

//REV 1
//cc 07-07-2015
//add firmware version
